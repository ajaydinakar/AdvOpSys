Additional Code Attribution
We didn’t add to the starter code in project, but took it as reference and wrote differently to look concise and efficient with few new modules and methods like . Also, we didn’t used fifo.py, clock.py in our code as in starter code, instead of fifo.py we used a module called deque from collections library. Every member in the team supported each and have given contribution in every module in the project with 100% effort. Every one learned a lot in the project by researching about the python language, oops concepts, working with inbuilt python libraries and modules etc. Can’t give credits to a particular group member and its team effort.  
Time spent on the project by the team: 21 days.
